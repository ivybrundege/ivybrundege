## Hi, nice to meet you!

I'm Ivy, a current senior earning dual degrees in Computer Science and Computational & Systems Neuroscience at Virginia Tech. My goal is to utilize my computational, research, and data science skills to answer the questions I'm most curious about. 

### So, what have I been curious about lately?
  - What can artificial neural networks tell us about how our sensory systems process and integrate information (hint: see my current research below)
  - How do computational models account for human learning and memory?
  - How can we develop ethical AI moving forward? Where does AI belong within the research world?
    
### So what am I currently up to?:
**Investigating the Neural Correspondence of Speech-Based Neural Networks**
  - I've been spending the summer at the McDermott Lab for Computational Audition at MIT via the MSRP-Bio Program!
  - My project involves benchmarking numerous state-of-the-art ASR models for their performance on various human auditory tasks and their correspondence to the brain.
  - For example, are models tuned to the same temporal structure of speech as humans? Do specific features or "regions" in these models emerge as speech-responsive regions, much in the same way we see with human brains and the superior temporal cortex?

### Previous work:
**Undergraduate Research with the Development, Education, and Learning Lab**
  - Under the supervision of Dr. Lei Yuan at CU Boulder, I developed an independent research project to examine the internal structure of intelligence in the brain
  - Using longitudinal cognitive scores datasets, I analyzed how cognitive tasks develop and interact over time. This involved using approaches such as psychometric network analysis.

**RAG Model Development with Axle Informatics**
  -  Through Cornell's *Break Through Tech AI* fellowship, I worked on a team with Axle Informatics to prepare data for a RAG-based model
  -  Using Python and  7 terrabytes (!!!) of data, we analyzed how to best incorporate data into a training dataset for the model
