## Hi, nice to meet you!

I'm Ivy, a current junior earning a dual degree in Computer Science and Computational Neuroscience at Virginia Tech. My goal is to utilize my computational, research, and data science skills to answer the questions I'm most curious about. 

### So, what have I been curious about lately?
  - How can ML be used to enhance our understanding of sensory representations in the brain? (I've been reading [this paper](https://dicarlolab.mit.edu/biblio/aligning-model-and-macaque-inferior-temporal-cortex-representations-improves-model-human-behavioral/) comparing CNNs to the structure of the inferior temporal lobe during object recognition tasks!!)
  - What does "general intelligence" mean when it comes to our brains? How do factors like intelligence arise? (hint: check out my lab research below :))
  - How can we develop ethical AI moving forward? Where does AI belong within the research world?

### Some projects of mine, as of late:
**Undergraduate Research with the Development, Education, and Learning Lab**
  - Under the supervision of Dr. Lei Yuan at CU Boulder, I've been developing an independent research project to examine the internal structure of intelligence in the brain
  - Using longitudinal cognitive scores datasets, I've been analyzing how cognitive tasks develop and interact over time

**RAG Model Development with Axle Informatics**
  -  Through Cornell's *Break Through Tech AI* fellowship, I've been working on a team with Axle Informatics to prepare data for a RAG-based model
  -  Using Python and  7 terrabytes (!!!) of data, we've been analyzing how to best incorporate data into a training dataset for the model
