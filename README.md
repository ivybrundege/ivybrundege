## Hi, nice to meet you!

I'm Ivy, a current junior earning a dual degree in Computer Science and Computational Neuroscience. In other words -- I love anything that combines technology and our brains.

### Some projects I've been working on recently:
  - Undergraduate research with the DEL Lab at CU Boulder
  - PDF Parsing for RAG Models with Axle Informatics
  - AI Studio Fellowship through Cornell University's Break Through Tech program
